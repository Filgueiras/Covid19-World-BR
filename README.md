# Covid19-World-BR
Data about Covid-19 joinning World and Brazil data. I did it because I'd like to see detailed data about brazilian States - and check if the quarantine it's working or not in way to flatten the curve. 
The code is in SAS and you can download a virtual machine on SAS web site and start learning it. The virtual learning environment has some free resources (including the VM I mentioned).
World data: Johns Hopkins (US data also).
Brazil data: official central government data (covid.saude.gov.br, download button).

About the folder structure (and a little bit about the data). 
2020/04/09: the data structure of the project is defined, but the information in my machine is structured in a different manner. The files path need to be changed before run the codes. I will update de the files everyday. Brazilian data will be accumulated. The world data, don't - you can pick the data in the Johns Hopkins repository. Ah, I put a data source from Europe, but didn't work on it (and I don't know if I will, but is good to know other data sources).
